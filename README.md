This repository contains files that set up a password generator website - an HTML file, a CSS file, and a java script file. When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" function, a series of prompts will pop up and ask the user a series of questions for password requirements. Each prompt will determine what the password will contain and the website will display a randomly generated password for the user. If a user does not fulfill all the requirements of the prompts, they will be prompted again until all requirements are satisfied.
